# Programming-Languages
Repository to store algorithms in different languages to be able to understand the different types of languages and their syntax rules.

Here is some information about the languages that are being used in this repository.

1. C
--
 - Compiled language
 - Procedural language
 -  C is one of the oldest languages that are still in use. It is created for using on UNIX OS.
 - C must be specifically compiled for computers with different architectures and operating systems. This feature makes the language run faster on systems but reduce the portable ability.
 - The main strength of the language is it's speed.
 - The weakness is the hard to learn memory management.
 - Main usage is systems programming.

2. Java
--
 - Not compiled language but it has a compiler.
 - Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOP)
 - Well designed and organized syntax and structure makes great language.
 - Java can be run on many computers nowadays because of JVM
 - Code portability WORA(write once, run anywhere)
 - Strengths of the language is WORA and popularity
 - Weaknesses slower than C/C++

3. Python
--
 - Interpreted Language
 - Scripting Language
 - Multi-paradigm Programming language
 - Readability is so important and the elegant code encouragement was pushing to the users.
 - Strengths are excellent readability, popularity, community, libraries and overall philosophy
 - There no major weaknesses of the language because most weaknesses are solved by 3rd party functions.

4. JavaScript
--
 - Interpreted Language
 - Scripting Language
 - Multi-paradigm Programming Language
 - Language of the web Scripting
 - Usage area is increasing with huge speeds.
 - Strength is JS is the only reliable client-side language for now
 -  Weakness is to be available on only web browsers, but there are some libraries such as Node.JS to solve this weakness

5. C++
--
 - Compiled Language
 - Multi-paradigm language
 - Strong as C with OOP
 - Strength is the Speed like its ancestor
 - Weaknesses are the old age, Java and C# are more useable.

6. R
--
 - Interpreted Language
 - Statistical Programming Language
 - Can be used as a functional Language
 - Multi-paradigm Language
 - Strengths are very easy to use for scientific computing, making graphs and Statistical analysis are cool, community, libraries

 - Weaknesses are hard to master, and speed

7. Theano Library of Python
--


8. Prolog
--
 - Logic Programming Language


9. Octave GNU
--

10. Objective-C
