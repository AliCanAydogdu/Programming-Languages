 // This is the first way of defining objects
 var student1 = {
   name: "Enes",
   age : 21,
   gpa : 3.68,
   gradeLevel: "Senior"
 }

// Prints name of the student1
console.log(student1.name)

// Prints gpa of the student1
console.log(student1.age)

// Prints the whole object

console.log(student1)

// This is another way of defining objects
student2.name = "Joe";
student2.age = 23;
student2.gpa = 1.2;
student2.gpa = "Junior";

console.log(student2);


// There is third way but eehh,
